This package allows calculating page-rank and personalized page-rank via power iteration with PyTorch,
which also supports calculation on GPU (or other accelerators).

## üí™ Getting Started

As a simple example, consider this simple graph with five nodes.
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/source/img/small_graph.svg" height="300">
</p>

Its edge list is given as
```python-console
>>> edge_index = torch.as_tensor(data=[(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)]).t()
```

We can use
```python-console
>>> page_rank(edge_index)
tensor([0.1269, 0.3694, 0.2486, 0.1269, 0.1281])
```
to calculate the page rank, i.e., a measure of global importance.
We notice that the central node receives the largest importance score,
while all other nodes have equal importance.

We can also calculate *personalized* page rank which measures importance
from the perspective of a single node.
For instance, for node `2`, we have
```python-console
>>> personalized_page_rank(edge_index=edge_index, indices=[2])
tensor([[0.1103, 0.3484, 0.2922, 0.1103, 0.1388]])
```

By the virtue of using PyTorch, the code seamlessly works on GPUs, too, and
supports auto-grad differentiation. Moreover, the calculation of personalized
page rank supports automatic batch size optimization via
[`torch_max_mem`](https://github.com/mberr/torch-max-mem).

## üöÄ Installation

<!-- Uncomment this section after your first ``tox -e finish``
The most recent release can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/torch_ppr/) with:

```bash
$ pip install torch_ppr

### üç™ Cookiecutter

This package was created with [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)'s
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) package using [@cthoyt](https://github.com/cthoyt)'s
[cookiecutter-snekpack](https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack) template.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

<details>
  <summary>See developer instructions</summary>


The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### Development Installation

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/mberr/torch-ppr.git
$ cd torch-ppr
$ pip install -e .
```

### ü•º Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be
run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/mberr/torch-ppr/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### üìñ Building the Documentation

The documentation can be built locally using the following:

```shell
$ git clone git+https://github.com/mberr/torch-ppr.git
$ cd torch-ppr
$ tox -e docs
$ open docs/build/html/index.html
``` 

The documentation automatically installs the package as well as the `docs`
extra specified in the [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg). `sphinx` plugins
like `texext` can be added there. Additionally, they need to be added to the
`extensions` list in [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py).

### üì¶ Making a Release

After installing the package in development mode and installing
`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are contained within the `finish` environment
in `tox.ini`. Run the following from the shell:

```shell
$ tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses [Bump2Version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to switch the version number in the `setup.cfg`,
   `src/torch_ppr/version.py`, and [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py) to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel using [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)
3. Uploads to PyPI using [`twine`](https://github.com/pypa/twine). Be sure to have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this
   step
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump the version by minor, you can
   use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.
